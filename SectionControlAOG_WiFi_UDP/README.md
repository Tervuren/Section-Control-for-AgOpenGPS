To be able to upload to the aliexpress board, you will need a TTL/USB adapter.

# Coming soon

The WiFi code is currently basic, you must enter your login/password in the code. A web page will be available to configure it directly.
The code should be extended to 16 sections by combining two panels.
Possible use of push buttons.
